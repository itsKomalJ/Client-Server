# Client-Server

A simple android application developed to show the the estamblishment of two remote device connected on same network subnate mask.

Here, one device can be the server and other will be client. The server will display the IP address and port number the client has
to connect to.

It is just once client-one server communication for now working successfully based on Socket Programming.

Hint: To test the application, Create hotspot on server and connect client device to it.Whenever the connection is estamblish,
      it will show acknowlege at both server and client device.

Future scope: It can be used to sent custom message, just like whatsapp use to or sharing of files can also takes place. :)
